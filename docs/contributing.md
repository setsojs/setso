### Setting up an enviorment

First, you got to setup setso. First fork and clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/setso.git
```

Then, you need to install the local dependencies. You need to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). Install it and then run the following command.

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Preparing for pushes

Before you push, make sure you prepare your code. This can be easly done with

```shell
pnpm prepare
```

This will format and lint the code.

You pr will fail if you have not prepared your code
